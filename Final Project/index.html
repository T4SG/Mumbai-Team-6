          <h2>Schools that need your help</h2>
          <p>JOSE EMILIO PACHECO BERNY TELESECONDAY SCHOOL

Coscomatepec, Veracruz Mexico

Each year the Jose Emilio Pacheco Berny Telesecondary school is damaged by annual floods. This causes its 80 students to miss weeks of classes as the school recovers. The current structure is very old, unsafe and will continue to be flooded each year.

This proactive and committed community is eager to send their children to a safer school. The community members have already worked with the Mexican government to secure a donation of land away from the flood zone and a donation of new furniture from the Minister of Education in Veracruz. Along with the generous support of Lexington Partners, all that is left to do for this community is to build a new school! With your help we can provide a new safe-resilient school for the Coscomatepec community!</p>

          <p><br><br><br>The Head Teacher at TK Pringan Adji, Indonesia

This new kindergarten is a great change especially for our children, who can now enjoy to learn in a comfortable place, they can improve their learning skills thanks to a variety of toys provided by donors. Also they really enjoy their nice and new playground, which help develop the children motor skills in a fun way.

The biggest change is that now more and more parents want to send their children to TK Priangan Adji. They are confident and proud of our kindergarten. We are very proud of that and very grateful to Happy Hearts Fund.</p>

          <h2> Schools that need your help</h2>
          <p>DIVINO NINO JESUS SECONDARY SCHOOL<br>
Chincha, Peru
In August of 2007 a 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Peru destroying the Divino Nino Jesus primary school in Chincha. Happy Hearts Fund, SURA  and Lexington Partners jointly rebuilt the school in 2012.

Since its reconstruction in 2012, the enrollment rate has grown over 50%, extensively exceeding capacity. Therefore the community built a temporary secondary school across from the primary school. This temporary structure is not in healthy condition and is not safe to withstand a future earthquake. With your help HHF will build a new safe-resilient secondary school with the capacity to host over 100 children for this proactive community in need.</p>
